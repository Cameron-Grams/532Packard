# The Project File for [ 532 Packard's information site ]( http://www.532packard.com )

This site was built with React and has a single Node endpoint serving the contact form. It also incorporates Google Maps through a component.   

This is a commercial site for an apartment rental business in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Most of the tenants are students.  The landlord was looking for an easy way to share photos of the apartments and the building.
